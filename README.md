Midsummer's Eve
===============
Misummer's Eve is a text adventure game that I made using [Adventuron](https://adventuron.io). It can be played in the browser at https://grizel.itch.io/midsummer.

This game was made as a submission for the [2023 Text Adventure Literacy Project (TALP) Jam](https://itch.io/jam/talp2023). The purpose of the jam is to make text adventure games that are playable by people of all ages and levels of familiarity with the text adventure genre.
